# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Manual Steps Required in GitHub Repository

Since the automated deployment failed, please follow these steps manually:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Sahamhalal/neuro-quranic-upgrade
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

### 2. Check Workflow Permissions
1. In your repository Settings
2. Go to **Actions** → **General** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure:
   - **Read and write permissions** is selected
   - **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** is checked

### 3. Trigger Manual Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select **master** branch
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- The workflow should complete successfully
- Your site will be available at: https://sahamhalal.github.io/neuro-quranic-upgrade/

## Technical Changes Made

✅ **Fixed Router Configuration**: Added proper basename for GitHub Pages
✅ **Fixed SPA Routing**: Added 404.html and redirect scripts
✅ **Simplified Workflow**: Combined build and deploy jobs
✅ **Local Build Test**: Confirmed build works locally (344KB bundle)

## If Issues Persist

If the deployment still fails, the most common issues are:
1. GitHub Pages not enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
2. Insufficient workflow permissions
3. Repository visibility (ensure it's public for GitHub Pages)

The code is ready and builds successfully - it's likely a repository configuration issue.
